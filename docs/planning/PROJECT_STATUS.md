## 🎯 Mission Statement

Create a modern, privacy-respecting, algorithmically intelligent book platform that is **fundamentally better** than Goodreads—not just incrementally better.

**Core Innovation:** Replace 5-star ratings with a **7-dimensional rating system** that captures the nuanced complexity of reading experiences.

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 📋 Strategic Documentation (23,000+ words)

#### 1. PRODUCT_VISION.md (8,500 words)

**✅ Multi-dimensional rating CRUD**
```bash
# Create rating
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ratings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"book_id": 1, "pace": 4, "emotional_impact": 5, ...}'

# Get rating
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ratings/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get fingerprint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ratings/1/fingerprint
```

**✅ Recommendation engine**
```python
from app.services.recommendations import get_personalized_recommendations

recommendations = await get_personalized_recommendations(
    db, user_id=123, limit=10
)
# Returns: [{"book": Book, "reason": "...", "score": 0.9}, ...]
```

**✅ Embeddings generation**
```python
from app.services.embeddings import generate_book_embedding

embedding = generate_book_embedding(
    title="The Night Circus",
    author="Erin Morgenstern",
    description="...",
    genres=["Fantasy", "Romance"]
)
# Returns: [0.123, -0.456, ...] (384 floats)
```

**✅ Mood-based discovery**
```python
from app.services.recommendations import get_books_by_mood

comfort_books = await get_books_by_mood(db, mood="comfort", limit=10)
# Returns: Books with high emotion + lower complexity
```

## ⏳ What's Next (In Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Database Setup (1-2 days)

**Critical:**
- [ ] Initialize Alembic: `cd backend && alembic init alembic`
- [ ] Configure alembic.ini and env.py (see DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] Create migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add multi-dimensional ratings"`
- [ ] Enable pgvector: `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`
- [ ] Run migration: `alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Seed test data

**Validation:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('multi_dimensional_ratings', 'book_fingerprints');

-- Check sample data
SELECT * FROM multi_dimensional_ratings LIMIT 1;
```

### Phase 2: Testing (1-2 days)

**Backend tests:**
- [ ] Unit tests for rating endpoints (pytest)
- [ ] Test fingerprint calculations
- [ ] Test embedding generation

## 🎨 Design Decisions Made

### Why Multi-Dimensional Ratings?

**5-star ratings fail because they're:**
- ❌ Reductive (can't express "great prose, weak plot")
- ❌ Unstable (changes with mood/time)
- ❌ Incomparable (your 3-star ≠ my 3-star)
- ❌ Meaningless precision (3.7 vs 3.8?)

**Multi-dimensional ratings solve this:**
- ✅ Nuanced expression (7 independent dimensions)
- ✅ Visual clarity (radar charts)
- ✅ Smart recommendations (vector similarity)
- ✅ Optional dimensions (rate only what matters)
- ✅ Better discovery (query by feel, not just genre)

### Why Next.js over React?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ SEO (book pages indexed by Google)
- ✅ Performance (server components, automatic optimization)
- ✅ Better DX (file-based routing, built-in optimization)
- ✅ Same React underneath (easy migration)

### Why pgvector?

**Enables fast similarity search:**
- Without: O(N) - compare to every book
- With pgvector: O(log N) - approximate nearest neighbors
- Critical for production scale (>10K books)

### Why Sentence Transformers?

**Better than keyword matching:**
- Semantic similarity ("mystery" ≈ "detective")
- Cross-genre discovery (literary mysteries with beautiful prose)
- Works in 384 dimensions (not just genre tags)

We're building **the book platform readers deserve** in 2026:
- 🛡️ **Privacy-first** (no data selling, no dark patterns)
- 🧠 **Intelligent** (context-aware recommendations, not just genre matching)
- 🎨 **Beautiful** (modern UI, radar charts, clean design)
- 📊 **Nuanced** (multi-dimensional ratings, not reductive stars)
- 🚀 **Fast** (Next.js, async backend, optimized queries)

**The foundation is solid. Now we build the experience.**
